# A Brief Introduction on SVG in Web Development

**By Mateus Pereira**

I have recently started my first studies in web development and found this amazing tool for webdesign. If you have found this abbreviation somewhere around the internet and want to know a bit more about it you came to the right place.

To begin, SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics, and a quick definition for it would be an image made out of math(coordinates to be more specific). You might be asking what does that mean, and to understand that first you need to give close look at a common image (.jpg, .png, etc).

The more you zoom in, it will gradually lose quality. That happens because these images are made of pixels and as you zoom they will become observable. However, SVG is made of coordinates that will always hold on to its shape. You can even open the .svg file on a text editor and see the coordinates that control the graphic shown. No matter how much you manipulate the image, its resolution remains sharp and clear.

When it comes to usage, SVG is a powerful tool in a world in which screens are diverse like the ones we have today. The reason for it is the scalable feature that makes it possible to show a single logo on a mobile screen as it would on an electronic billboard. It also works great for creating animations using all sorts of visual elements that can be pretty easily added to HTML/CSS code.

For the ones who got more interested in it, there is a free editor called [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) where you can generate your .svg files and have a go.

By the way, if you are planning on using it on a react app you might find it difficult to insert your .svg code in the JS/JSX pages, for that you might want to optimize it(get rid of unimportant info that comes in the SVG code), for that there is always an online tool like [SVGOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/).
