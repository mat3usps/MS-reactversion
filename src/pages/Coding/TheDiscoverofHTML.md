# The Discovery of HTML

### By Mateus Pereira

One of the most necessary for website development in current times, HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is perhaps the one requirement for anyone who has an interest in the area. This necessity comes from the importance that HTML plays in the structuralization of webpages. Besides its simplicity, this language is irreplaceable, independent, and, thanks to the constant release of new versions, up to date.

To begin with, HTML is both uncomplicated and accessible. While some other languages work based on mathematical logic, this language is based on pretty easy use of tags to translate a structure to the computer. The system of tags works in a way that every person who knows how to compose correctly the tags, is a potential developer.

Regarding the use of HTML in current days, this language has reached the status of irreplaceable. Due to the great support given to HTML by browsers, the role of the language rapidly ascended to become a worldwide tool. Nowadays, while the obsolescence of few tags is a reality, the hegemony of this language remains still.

Moreover, HTML is an independent tool in website development that is constantly updated. The basic tools of contemporaneity for developing most websites are: HTML structure, CSS styles, and, depending on the use of the website, some Javascript might come in handy. However, even now days is still possible to build a website using only HTML. Though it may have lost few functionalities with deprecated tags, some recent versions bring in new tags and functions that end up repaying the loss.
