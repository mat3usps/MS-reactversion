# The Importance of SRP in React Components

**By Mateus Pereira**

Those acquainted with ReactJS, might be a little tired of hearing about components, but there’s something about them that seems to be the main idea for components to work the way they do, that is, the Single Responability Principle.

The principle holds to the idea of keeping the parts of the code short so that they can each have a single responsability, as its name claims. The usage of react for building apps and websites consists in creating components, giving the main code the ability of being divided in smaller parts. It is possible to underestimate the power contained in this ability, but most devs who work with it will make this recomandation.

There might be other positives about the use of components. As the main code is divided, it becomes easier for the code to be analyzed and maintained should the necessity come in the future. Another good one is the fact that rather than big blocks of code, smaller components can be easily modified and inserted in other applications.

To put in a nutshell, SRP is a well known practice that besides bringins na amount of benefits, is always looked upon with good eyes by devs around the world.
